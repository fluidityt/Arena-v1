#### BUG:


#### NEXTACTION:
- make a big empty node that you can removeChildren() for all enemies

#### NEEDSDONE:
- algo to crossplatform / resolution speed 

### TODO:
- adjust minspeed (super jumpy dir changes)
- make sliders for CONFIG values
- make 'margin of error' for hit detection


#### RESEARCH:
- how to destroy a node
- trailing skaction


#### OTHERTODOS:
- figure out where to store class info in configs

I dont even need hit detection.. can precompute or use .position! or can have a trailing

			i dont think that the timer values are going to be different before / after the func

			bug: ..fuck.. still only spawning on top right... and speed is fucked
			
			bug: .. as framerate drops, wheel spin slows...
			
			bug.. not spawning to side 4.. looks like circle aggro
					also.. not printing from case statement
