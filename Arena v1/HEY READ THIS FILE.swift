	class NewClass {

		// Initials one space down (pseudo blocks are 1 spaced)
		let 
				constant1			 = 0,
				constant2 		 = 2,

				other_constant = 5


		// Next task is two spaces down
		print ("this has nothing to do with the previous task")

		print ("but this does, so it's only one space apart, but")

		// Welp..
		print ("comments don't matter, it's still one space out.")


		/// Next task is still two spaces out
		func amazingFunc(use_constant: Int) -> Int {
		
				// Don't forget only space out
